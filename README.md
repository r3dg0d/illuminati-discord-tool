# illuminati-discord-tool
Codename Illuminati is a Discord AI that detects nudity in discord video calls, and chat, and bans users if found.
Kinda like Apple's new tool they are implementing on iPhones, using hashes, but instead of hashes, we are using a custom algorithm that detects nudity from a database of images. Eventually want to be able to detect it in video calls, using frame-by-frame analysis, or another, less storage-intensive method.

Lets provide a safer space for people to chat. #ProjectIlluminati on twitter.

#To-Do
- Code a discord bot template in python
- Code a way to make discord bot join vc then record call
- Code algorithm, if it detects nudity, Ban user instantly.
- Create .wav for bot to say in vc when it joins stating that the call is recording for any rule-breakers.
