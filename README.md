# Illuminati-discord-tool
Codename Illuminati is a multi-purpose discord bot used for AI, ML, and data-collection.

# To-Do (WIP)
- Code a discord bot template in node javascript with discord.js
- Code a voice-to-text model that decodes voices to text. Using voice data from discord voice chats.
- Code a question-queue system, using commands and inputs, if the bot is in a voice channel, then it responds with random tts trained on discord users voice.
- Recognize Wakeword in Real-time in voice channel
- Speak the .wav files from the TTS into the discord vc
- Code a way to make discord bot join vc then record call for data, then post the recording in a channel to download.
- Create an audio file for bot to say it is in a voice channel when it joins stating that the call is recording for data-collection for use with AI. 
- Add image based detection that detects Memes in discord, and responds with what it sees. Like the explain bots on twitter.
- Code a garbage collector that collects all messages in a specified channel and records it to a .CSV
- Add multiple micro-bots (Codename: Illuminati) that run on Large-Scale Storage solutions and record discord calls and video calls, with consent from the user(s). These are real artificial intelligence tests to see if AI can pass the turing-test. Must be run with humans. We've seen what happens when AI is unsupervised, it's not good.
- Make a virtual assistant from scratch, and make a command for it to join a vc. (Codename: SIVA)
- Use some NLP (Natural Language Processing) for processing requests that the bot doesn't understand. Use LaMBDa or OpenAI's GPT-3, or even better 
- Code a way for the bot to record each discord message, and put it in a .csv file. Add start and stop command.

# Notes
Codename: Illuminati needs storage for video recordings, audio, text, and images. Over the long-course of use, these recordings could use something called: Big Data. I'd recommend making a home data server, having a lot of storage, or using an NAS (network attached storage). These could be pretty pricey depending on how much storage is needed for the ML, and other code for the software. However once the software is pitched and sold to some big discord servers, it could come out to pay for operating costs.
